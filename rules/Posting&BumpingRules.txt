[b]Discipline and Warning Procedure[/b]
We use a 3 Warn system at RERN. If you break a rule, typically you will receive a verbal warning first. If rule breaking continues, you will receive a Forum Warn. A Forum Warn goes away after approximately one month, unless otherwise stated (more serious rule breaking results in longer Warns.) If you accumulate 3 Warns, you will be banned from the forum for one month. If, for some reason, you receive 3 Warns after a month ban, you will be permanently banned.
