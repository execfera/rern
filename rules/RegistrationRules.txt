Post your registration in the [url=https://rockman-rogue.net/category/65/new-users-rebirths][u]New Users[/u][/url] section of the Registration area. Once it has an "Approved" or "Accepted" by either an [color=darkorange][b]Administrator[/b][/color] or an [color=green][b]Official[/b][/color], you post your Operator and NetNavi profiles in the respective areas. [url=https://rockman-rogue.net/category/102/navi-profiles][u]Navi Profiles[/u][/url] & [url=https://rockman-rogue.net/category/73/operator-profiles][u]Operator Profiles[/u][/url]

Additional Notes:[ul]
[li]No Real World weapons. (By which we mean the Navi can and SHOULD have a weapon, but the Operator should not.)[/li]
[li]No main-series references in your registration. (IE: "About as tall as Mega Man", or "Has Search Man's gun.")[/li]
[li]For that matter, no main-series references in your backstory, either. (You don't have to make a backstory, but if you do, no main-series references.)
