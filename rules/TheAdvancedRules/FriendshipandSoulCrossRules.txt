[b]Friendship System[/b]

The Friendship System measures your characters' relationship with another character. The system is based on Friendship Points, which is the quantitative measure of your relationship at the current time. 

Gaining Friendship Points (FXP) can be done by team busting, netbattles, or non-combat interactions. Team busting is the most basic way to gain points. For each area, there is a ratio of how many viruses you would need to delete with your friends to gain a point. All ratios round up.
[quote=][u]Virus:Points Area[/u]
      5:1       ACDC
      4:1       Scilabs
      3:1       Electown, Yoka, Netopia, Dentech, Beach Street, Okuden, Kotobuki
      2:1       Sharo, Yumland, Netfrica, Netvegas, Hades Isle, NAXA
      1:1       Undernet
Battle 5, 10, 15, and 20 Minibosses get a x2 modifier.
Rouge Nets get x1.5 to base FXP earned for deleting viruses.
Chaos Nets get x2 to base FXP earned for deleting viruses.
Undernet get x3 to base FXP earned for deleting viruses.[/quote]
At the end of each battle, players will be rewarded with FXP based on the events that transpired. The moderator will tell you with who and how much FXP you gain. Note that FXP between two Navis is always the same amount, and must be kept track of in your signature.[ul]

[li]Certain actions can merit extra FXP. These actions would be determined by the moderator's own judgment, and should be based on an action AND reaction (or a pair of posts).[/li]


[li]Interaction between operators can result in 1 FXP per pair of quality back and forth posts.[/li]


[li]Noncombat interaction between Navis can result in 1 or 2 FXP per pair of quality back and forth posts.[/li]


[li]When both Navis and Operators are present for interaction, the result can be up to 3 FXP per pair of quality back and forth posts.[/li]

[b]Using FXP[/b]

Crosses are earned based on FXP. Once you achieve a certain amount of points, you may apply for the Cross. Gaining the Cross removes no points.

Level 2 : 70
Level 3 : 150
Level 4 : 250
Level 5 : 400[/quote]
[b]Applying for a Cross[/b]

ExampleMan and AverageMan's Friendship is at 30 FXP. They apply for a level 1 Cross, which requires at least 30 FXP. It is approved, no points are "used up", so they still retain their FXP. Once they attain 70 FXP, they can apply for a level 2 Cross.

[li]There is no turn limit on how long a Cross lasts inside one battle.

[b]Faction Crosses[/b]

Crosses of your same faction gain the benefit of reduced requirements of FXP for each cross. That is, if you are in the NetPolice, any other NP member cross that you've worked towards (player or NPC) will require less FXP to level up.
