Any non-breaking attack that strikes the Yo-Yo is nullified instantly, and the Yo-Yo is neither slowed nor stopped by them. Thus, head-to-head combat against Yorts is suicide unless the opponent is able to produce a Break attack of 40 or more damage to destroy the Yo-yo. Yorts cannot regenerate a destroyed Yo-Yo, and are completely helpless without it. If a Yort is deprived of its weapon, it will Escape after 2 turns. Yorts cannot damage other Yorts. If two Yo-yos collide in mid-air, they mutually annihilate each other. Yorts can't move while attacking. Yort attacks are faster than the battlechip version of Yo-Yo and have greater range, but have a tiny delay before the attack in exchange. Yo-Yos are immune to every effect (including Glitch) except Break. AoE effects can reach past a Yo-Yo, but do nothing to stop it. Yo-Yos self destruct if the Yort that fired them is deleted.",

Vineys are rooted in place, and cannot be moved. The main body of a Viney is immune to any and all forms of attack except fire element damage, but the vines the viruses uses to attack with are vulnerable to all attacks. The virus attacks by using a group of thorny vines to creep up out of a nearby panel, then move towards the victim in hopes of capturing them. Once the vines make contact, they wrap around the victim, and hold them in place while causing damage. The vines can only be escaped from by the target if the target dedicates an action with decent roleplay attempting to escape. The vines may also be cut or burned in order to allow the target to escape, but in the case of fire, the target sustains double the fire damage of the attack used to burn the vines. Summoning the group of vines requires an action, moving the vines requires an action, and damage is dealt to a captured target for each action the Viney spends trying to hold the target in place. Both the vines and the virus itself are damage zones. Any damage either one sustains counts against the virus' HP. Both are subject to terrain effects and those effects stack as if the virus were in two places at the same time (because it basically is).",

FlashBombs thrown by BigHats do not harm viruses at all when they explode. The effect of FlashBomb cannot be dodged, but it can be blocked by defenses you can take cover behind, such as objects and Guards. Chip generated barriers and auras also prevent the effect, but signature generated defenses of these types will not. As FlashBomb is a light based attack, it has slashing to pierce Shadow, and Seeking to pierce Invis (note that dodging alone does nothing, so Invis will not help here anyway).",

While non-dominerd viruses are present, Dominerds will block attacks against other viruses with their own bodies, and will take turns blocking these attacks. Dominerds have StoneBody, but must drop their defenses to attack an enemy. Dominerds will only start attacking when they are alone, or the only other viruses on the field are also Dominerds. All Dominerds carry and use stage changing chips. Dominerds do not intentionally use their Teleport abilities evasively, and tend to rely on Invisibility instead. Thus a strategy of attacking a Dominerd by forcing it to defend or countering when it attacks will negate any evasion bonus it may have gained from teleportation, as well as invis.

Two menacing red eyes leer out from the shadows in the crack between them, and a swirl of dark energy of the same color as the data whirls around the entire virus constantly. A Mimic only spawns if an MD is present, and the roll to check contents comes up as a Trap. The MD then becomes a single Mimic. Mimics do not ever appear otherwise. Once triggered, a Mimic either mass summons Viruses, Navis, or other Battle Programs for the next battle number, or mass teleports all allies to the location of the next battle (which is always within the same network area), and the battle begins immediately. These mass summon and mass teleport abilities are unique to Mimics, and cannot be emulated. When a Mimic is defeated, it reverts to MD form. At this point, it becomes ethereal, and cannot be damaged in any way.",

Gigas lack legs, and instead roll around on a 3 ton solid steel ball 2-feet in diameter that rests in a cupola. Rising from the top of the cupola is an alloy pillar that supports their metal bodies. The Gigas fight with their huge iron fists, which are provided their immese striking power by large barrel-like forearms. Their great-helm-like heads sit directly atop their shoulders with their blocky hinged jaw slanted in a sneer while their neon-red eyes radiate their hatred of all things Navigator. It is speculated that Gigas are a hacked derivative of the Bladia viruses spliced together with fragments of other viruses and a healthy dose of battlechip program data. This would account for their size, strength, and malicious nature. Where and how this was possibly accomplished is unknown. Gigas move at increased speed, but dodge at a slower than average rate. Gigas viruses prefer to pummel the life out of their foes with their bare hands (even though using the ball-and-chain in melee range would be more devastating), but if they find themselves surrounded or at a great distance to their target, they will use the ball-and-chain to perform a HammerToss. If an object blocks their path, they will either send it flying with a GigasArm attack, or smash it to dust before continuing on. Gigas will sink like the lead weights they are in liquid, and they know it. They will avoid liquid terrain entirely, if possible, and will never appear near these types of naturally occuring terrain for this reason. Only a Gigas' body is damageable. Striking a Gigas' cast iron arms will not damage the virus or the arms themselves, no matter what you hit them with. The Gigas' will not intentionally defend themselves with their arms, as they should be too busy pummeling or hurling something to bother. Do not abuse this.",

Ashuraid viruses lack legs, and instead roll around on a 1 ton solid steel ball 1-foot in diameter that rests in a cupola. Rising from the top of the cupola is an alloy pillar that supports their smooth and curving metal bodies. The key defining feature of Ashuraid viruses are their half dozen free-floating arm segments constructed of an indestructible alloy. Three of these arms feature metallic rights hands, and the other three feature metallic left hands, thus they are differentiated. In combat, the virus will ball these hands up into fists, and launch volleys of rocket punches at their foes. The virus' helmeted head rests upon a short metallic rod-like neck with their faces hidden behind a metallic faceplate. The exception being their mouths, which are generally curved downwards in a permanent frown while in the presence of Navigators. It is speculated that Ashuraid are a hacked derivative of the Bladia viruses spliced together with fragments of other viruses and a healthy dose of battlechip program data. This would account for their size, strength, and malicious nature. Where and how this was possibly accomplished is unknown. Ashuraid viruses move and dodge at better than average speeds, although they rarely choose to dodge at all. Ashuraid viruses are ranged attackers, and prefer to hold the range open against their enemies as melee range attacks with their Impacting abilities generally render Counters useless. Ashuraids attack by launching their six free-floating indestructible alloy arms at one or more enemies in volleys of 3 rocket punches. It takes 3 arms to execute a MeteorKnucke attack, 3 to execute a Counter attack, and all 6 to execute their GiantHook attack. It takes roughly an action of cooldowm time after executing a long distance attack for the arms used in the attack to return to the Ashuraid's side. During this time, they may not execute a Counter Attack if they do not have enough arms available. Ergo if all 6 arms are either being used in an attack, or in cool-down following an attack or counter attack, the Ashuraid cannot use a Counter. The rest of their attacks do not require their arms to return to their side. The return feature is automatic, and does not require actions to perform. Ashuraid can move while attacking or defending, and are allowed to counter while dodging if enough arms are available. Setting a counter requires an action while executing one does not. Ashuraid are extremely heavy viruses that will sink like the lead weights they are in liquid, and they know it. They will avoid liquid terrain entirely, if possible, and will never appear near these types of naturally occurring terrain for this reason. Only an Ashuraid's body is damageable. Striking an Ashuraid's floating arms will not damage the virus or the arms themselves, no matter what you hit them with. The Ashuraids will not intentionally defend themselves with their arms outside of their Counter ability, which is nullified by Impact. Do not abuse this.",

Their faces are usually unseen, as they're covered in a red mask with string decorations. Their tails are twice as long as their actual bodies, and are usually curved into a question mark shape. At first this may seem like a simple design choice, but the tail is actually prehensile, and Bandcoon cleverly use it to steal chip data from Navis. Bandcoons' speed and small size combine to make them surprisingly difficult to hit while moving, and are even agile enough to turn sharply with little problem. However, if caught standing still, they're practically sitting ducks. However, when they're not using chips, they always prefer to move when possible. Their main tactic is to roll around and confound the enemy with their speed, then move in and swipe them with their tail, using it like a hook to grab data not directly tied to them, namely Battlechips. They can then use it themselves, at reduced power, as a free action. All other effects of the chips still apply, including pre-requisites to use the chip (i.e. Spice still needs Grass terrain, MachineSword still requires that the enemy be stunned). Higher level Bandcoon are aware of such conditions, and will try to satisfy the requirements if at all possible. If the enemy has no Battlechips, Bandcoons get extremely aggravated, and will ram an enemy in anger and desperation. However, they severely dislike doing this, and will only use this attack as a last resort for when they have no chips.",

It is much shorter in reality, however, if you look past the gigantic cranium it has on its head, which easily takes up a third of its total size. Bulging with folds and creases, it seems to pulse every few moments with electrical arcs running over its surface. With intelligence up and above most viruses (and some Navis), they will not hesitate to use more complex tactics than normal viruses. The V1, V2, and V3 versions have blue, purple and red skin respectively. Normal versions wear a white bodysuit with black trim, while EX versions wear a black bodysuit with white trim. The Z version has light green skin with purple bodysuit and black trim, and its eyes are entirely purple.",

		"family_note": "A Mettank is a combination of the Metool, Catack, and Armadillo viruses. It looks a lot like a regular Catack, with several notable differences. The main body of the tank is slightly smaller, and the tank's driver is very clearly an actual Metool, though it doesn't bear its signature weapon. The vehicle itself is colored to match the Metool-driver's Helmet; thus the most basic version is gold with green trim, while more powerful versions will be colored differently to follow suit. The tank itself retains the same basic design as a Catack, except that its triangular treads have been replaced with four almost comically over-sized monster-truck style armored wheels, and its main gun now sports two long, narrow tines jutting out vertically up and down from a point close to the muzzle. These make it look rather like a giant version of a Metool's pickaxe, and the cannon is also now housed in a vertical pivot that allows it to adjust up and down, or even swing with enough force to strike the lower tine to the ground.<br><br>Most of the time, the Mettank moves very slowly, and it has been seen to activate a defensive mode wherein the Metool-driver's helmet expands to a jumbo size large enough to cover the entire tank in its protective dome. This does, of course, render the virus utterly blind, and when specifically guarding like this it can no longer attack or move.<br><br>It has also been seen, occasionally, to display sudden feats of unexpected speed, where it will rev up, then suddenly ram a target. At these times, its helmet defense covers the tank, though it recedes again as soon as the attack run loses momentum.",

	"GrabBandit": {
		"family_note": "Navis without access to a useful amount of Slashing damage may struggle with the higher tier versions of this virus. Good RP is a perfectly good substitute in most cases, however the increasing shadow capabilities of the virus can prove problematic without. Check your target's arsenal before deploying this virus and consider carefully about doing so if their access to slashing is limited. Despite this, it should also be noted that this is not a particularly strong virus on its own, either in relative HP, or in offensive capabilities; it doesn't like the spotlight and will not fare well if deployed as the 'centre stage' focus of a battle.<br><br>For the most part, GrabBandit's prefer to remain hidden and the full extent of their actual form is hard to tell. Scattered reports have claimed that, when completely out of their shadow portals, the GrabBandit actually resembles a bandcoon, only larger, longer of body, sleek and lither, and seemingly made of solid shadow, with dazzling blue glows where its eyes should be. These stories also report that it sports a writhing forest of very long black tendrils that sprout from its back and wave about with a sentience of their own.<br><br>It appears quite nimble when on land, however the virus often moves within a ground-based portal, hidden from sight. When the portal is closed, with the GrabBandit inside, a shadow remains visible on the ground, a circle of roughly one panel, that heralds where the virus is. The portal shadow appears to move with great speed and precision, but only when it is not directly beneath a target. It flashes across the ground to rest directly under a new target, and the GrabBandit will generally attempt to attack that target right away, if it can. When fully out of the portal it is revealed to be, or at least to act as, the virus' own shadow.<br><br>In combat, they attempt to ensnare victims by means of opening the portal beneath their target and binding them quickly with a mass of black, shadowy vines. The portals can open to quite a wide size, depending on their target. Nothing but the GrabBandit can pass into or out of the portals, even while they are 'open'; even if one should be opened wide enough to leave a victim standing effectively on black empty space, it will seem like perfectly solid ground underfoot. Seeking attacks seem to disrupt the portal space, and eject the meta-virus back to normal netspace. Looking into a portal reveals only inky blackness, though very occasionally a flash of blue eye-glows might be glimpsed... Looking directly into an open portal is probably a bad idea anyway.<br><br>If the virus manages to bind a victim, a large pair Bandcoon paws, seemingly unattached to anything, rise out of the portal as well, and, accompanied by any spare tendrils or vines, perform a pat-down and search of its immobilised target, seeking recent chip data to steal and use. If, however, the GrabBandit is unable to use its vines, it will instead emerge from its portal in an effort to fully scope out the battlefield, moving defensively and attempting to ensure all targets are in its field of vision at once. As a defence mechanism, the GrabBandit appears to be able to flare the glows of its eyes brightly enough to bath the surrounding area in an over-powering blue light. It does this in a brief flash, fierce enough to leave victims dazzled and blinded, and even causing physical pain to those close by, before retreating into its portal again.<br><br>Between its defensive nature, and the efficiency of its movements while hidden, this virus has never been known to dodge or evade attackers, except by coincidence. Even when fully exposed it is usually far more interested in getting out of the spotlight quickly, or retreating into its portal again. Despite its shadowy appearance, the virus itself is solid enough that it does not count as being actually shadowed, though stronger variants of the virus have thrown this into question.",
